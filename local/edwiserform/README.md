The "Edwiser Forms" Moodle Plugin
================================

Features of Edwiser Forms,
Edwiser Forms gives you the power to create own forms with simple drag and drop functionality. It has common and advanced fields to cover most form elements. Layout fields help you to design form. Now Say goodbye to long form. Tabs layout allows you to create a form with multiple steps. Conditional logic lets you control you form flow. Google ReCaptcha field is available to keep forms safe from robot and attacks. Edwiser Forms gives you a shortcode to use anywhere in Moodle where the filter plugin can filter the content. Then this shortcode will be rendered as a form to submit data. You can preview form in a separate page. You can show form in the block or use our forms.php page to show it in a full page. You can export userâ€™s submissions into CSV format to use outside of Moodle. You can also export form definition and import the same while creating a new form. Golden point in Edwiser Form is that whenever a form is submitted, any event can be executed from the events list given in plugin.
