  @javascript
  Scenario: Teacher can see and use the Fill with correct link
    When I am on the "Course 1" "filter_embedquestion > test" page logged in as teacher
    And I set the field "Question category" to "Test questions [embed] (2)"
    And I set the field "id_questionidnumber" to "First question"
    And I press "Embed question"
    And I switch to "filter_embedquestion-iframe" iframe
    When I press "Fill with correct"
    Then the field "True" matches value "1"
    And I press "Check"
    And I should see "Correct"
    And I should see "Mark 1.00 out of 1.00"
    And "Fill with correct" "button" should not exist
    And I press "Start again"
    And I should not see "Correct"
    And the "Fill with correct" "button" should be enabled

  @javascript
